## Conway's Game of Life ‚Äì Terminal Version
A simple terminal-based implementation of Conway's Game of Life, written in Python.
The simulation displays cells evolving over time according to basic rules of life and death, with live cells shown as "‚ñ†" and dead cells as spaces.

# üß¨ What Is It?
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway.
Each cell on a grid lives or dies depending on the state of its 8 neighbors.

# üìú Rules
1. Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives.
2. Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation, and dead cells stay dead.

# üíª How to Run
Requirements
Python 3.x

Run the Program
"""bash
python game_of_life.py
"""
The simulation runs in the terminal.
Press Ctrl + C to stop the program at any time.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Grid size: 20x20 (modifiable via WIDTH and HEIGHT)
- Random initial grid
- No wrapping at edges (border cells have fewer neighbors)
- Terminal clearing for smooth animation
- Easy-to-modify code

# üß© Customize
- Cell symbols: Change CELLSTATE = ["‚ñ†", " "] to use other characters.
- Grid size: Modify WIDTH and HEIGHT at the top of the script.
- Frame delay: Change time.sleep(1) to speed up or slow down the animation.
- Initial pattern: Replace gridInit() with a custom starter layout.
